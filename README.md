# Evaluating NPU Performance for AI Tasks
-- Project Status: [IN PROGRESS]
-- Timebox: April 4, 2025

## Project Description
This project aims to test Neural Processing Unit (NPU) performance and compare it with other processor types in AI-driven tasks for a computer company.

### WHY? 
- The industry is heavily investing in NPU technology (Neural Processing Units).
- While customers and partners understand the concept of NPUs, there are no real benchmarks or use cases demonstrating their advantages for that company.
- Customers struggle to see the benefit of upgrading from older hardware to newer AI-powered devices.
- There is a lack of awareness about the advantages of running AI workloads locally instead of relying on cloud-based solutions.

## Objective
This project focuses on creating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that runs locally on several devices to evaluate AI task performance across different processors.

### Key Goals:
- Develop a local RAG tool to process and retrieve PDF content efficiently.
- Compare performance, battery life, and latency across different setups: CPU, NPU, and GPU.
- Generate real-time performance insights directly on the device.
- Deploy the solution in showroom to showcase the results to global customers and partners.
